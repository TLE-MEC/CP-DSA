Given two arrays arr1[] and arr2[] respectively of size m and n, the task is to merge these two arrays such that the initial numbers (after complete sorting) are in the first array and the remaining numbers are in the second array. Extra space allowed in O(1).

For this question, while traversing the two sorted arrays parallelly, if we encounter the jth second array element is smaller than ith first array element, then jth element is to be included and replace some kth element in the first array
