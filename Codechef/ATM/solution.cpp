// We are given an integer and a double value denoting Pooja's amount to be withdrawn and current bank balance.
// A given amount to be withdrawn is valid only if 
//     - it is a multiple of 5
//     - there is sufficient money in her account to withdraw the money as well as pay $0.50 to the bank as transaction fee.

// if a=amount to be withdrawn and b = total balance
// we will check if a is a multiple of 5 and if (a+0.50)<b:
//     if the condition is satisfied, we return (b-a-0.50) as the remaining balance 
//     else return b 

// TIME COMPLEXITY: O(1)
// SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)

// NOTE: 
// 1. Since input consists of decimal values, we use double to store ans.
// 2. The answer should have a precision of 2 decimal places, so we need to use setprecision(2)
