# If length of the string is larger than 20, we will need to delete some chars and
# appropriate deletion can reduce the number of replacements needed to break repeating
#  sequences after deletion. For any repeating sequences with len % 3 == 0, we need
#  to make len/3 replacements and we can reduce the number of replacements len/3 by
#  one by deleting one character. Similarly, for any repeating sequences with len % 3 == 1,
#  we can reduce one replacement by deleting two characters. Now we know that for all sequences,
#  including those already deleted chars from, we have len % 3 == 2 so we can reduce every
#  replacement by deleting three characters such that every deleting action counts.
